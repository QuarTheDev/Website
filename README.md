    Welcome to my very own website!

## History
### v1 <sup>[(view)](https://quarthe.dev/v1/)</sup>
The first website (v1) was made with Carrd and hosted on their servers, but later transferred to a Cloudflare Page under the name 'quarthedev'.

### v2 <sup>[(view)](https://dev.quarthe.dev/v2/)</sup>
The second variant of the website was written from the ground up in HTML, CSS, and JS. This was hosted on Cloudflare Pages for a while too, but later into its own site where it remains today (quarthe.dev).

### v3 <sup>[(view)](https://dev.quarthe.dev/)</sup>
This is the current version of the website, a complete rewrite from the ground up. Since v2, I've gained a lot of knowledge about hosting, web development, and graphic design. Since v2 was a big mess of code, I decided to start fresh with a sleek landing page for the curious.i
