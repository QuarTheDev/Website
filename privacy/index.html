<b>Introduction</b>
This Privacy Policy outlines the manner in which the Quar landing page handles information associated with the use of its services. It is intended to inform visitors of the operational standards and privacy measures that are set in place.

<b>Data Collection and Usage</b>
The Quar landing page is structured with end-user privacy in mind -- it functions without collecting personally identifiable information from its visitors. The absence of trackers or similar technologies ensures that visitors’ interactions with the site remain private and unmonitored.

<b>Analytics</b>
To maintain the integrity and performance of the site, Quar utilizes Cloudflare’s analytics services. These services are designed to respect user privacy and do not involve the harvesting of personally identifiable information. The analytics are used to monitor site performance, detect and mitigate potential threats, and ensure the continuous availability of the site. Visitors unfortunately cannot opt-out to analytics.

<b>Information Management</b>
The data collected through Cloudflare\’s analytics is strictly confined to non-personal information. This data is used to compile reports on site activity, which aids in the improvement of the site for a better user experience. The aggregated data may include metrics such as the number of visitors, the frequency of visits, and general usage patterns, but never personally identifiable information.

<b>Third-Party Services</b>
The Quar landing page may include links to third-party websites, including but not limited to sites like GitHub, Mastodon, or YouTube. This Privacy Policy does not in any way extend to external websites. It is recommended that visitors review the privacy policies of any third-party sites they choose to visit.

<b>Cloudflare’s Privacy Practices</b>
Given that the Quar landing page employs Cloudflare’s services, it is important for visitors to be aware of Cloudflare’s privacy practices. Visitors are encouraged to review Cloudflare’s privacy policy and terms of service to gain a comprehensive understanding of how their data may be managed.

<b>Cookies</b>
This site utilizes the Cloudflare Clearance cookie, identified as <code>cf_clearance</code>. This cookie is essential for accessing the website as it stores verification of a passed v2 challenge. Its presence ensures that subsequent challenges are not issued to the user. It is important to note that this cookie is neither maintained nor modifiable by Quar, but solely managed by Cloudflare. The use of <code>cf_clearance</code> is a standard practice for sites under Cloudflare’s protection to enhance security and user experience.

<b>Modifications to the Privacy Policy</b>
This Privacy Policy is dynamic and will be revised from time to time. Visitors are advised to review the policy periodically to stay informed of any changes. Continued use of the site following any changes indicates acceptance of the new terms.

<b>Effective Date</b>
This Privacy Policy is effective since 3 March 2024, and will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the site’s functionality.
